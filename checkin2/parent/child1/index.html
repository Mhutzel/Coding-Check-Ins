<h1> Who really <em> is </em> Yu Tsun? </h1>

<p> Yu Tsun is the protagonist of the story. He is a descendent of a wealthy and powerful Chinese family who used to teach English in China. However, now he finds himself working for the Germans as a spy- a job that he finds degrading. He hates the Germans and comes to like a British man who he sees to be modest, gracious, and wise. </p>

<p> Yu Tsun wants to prove to The Chief that a Chinese man can "save his armies" by discovering and passing along secret British information so he kills his British friend. Tsun succeeds but doesn't have much to show for it: condemned to hang, he winds up full of remorse. </p>
