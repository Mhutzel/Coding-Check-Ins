<h1>What <em> is </em> "The Garden of Forking Paths?" </h1>

<p> The garden shows up literally in the story. It's an idyllic space that Yu Tsun spends his childhood, a place of seclusion for Yu Tsun's ancestor, Ts'ui Pen, and a maze that Yu Tsun must walk through in order to arrive at Dr. Albert's library and ultimately learn of the hidden cache of British weapons.</p>

<p> The garden is also a metaphor. It represents the infinite diverging narratives of Ts'ui Pen's novel, which is a metaphor in itself. </p>

<h4> The Labyrinth and The World Wide Web </h4>
<p> In regards to hypertext and the web, the garden, or labryinth, provides connections to other spaces like another web page or in the instance of the story, another time. The internet is a landscape before us to be explored. </p>
